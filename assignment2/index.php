		<p>My name is Matt Resnikoff. I am currently a Junior at the U of R, majoring in Economics and double minoring in Computer Science and Journalism. I got into Comp Sci fairly recently, but I have a lot of fun with the coding aspects which is why I decided to start off as the group coder.</p>
		<p>I really like tennis, both watching and playing. I just recently joined the varsity team after being a part of the club team for the past two and a half years. My favorite player is Roger Federer (duh). I'm also into watching other pro sports, mainly Football and Basketball. I'm a huge Indianapolis Colts fan so don't try talking to me about football right now since it was a pretty rough year for me.  </p>

		<h2>More about me!</h2>
		<p>On top of being pretty into sports I also am a big comic book guy. I'm a huge fan of all the Marvel movies that've been coming out, not so keen on the DC stuff since it's kind of sucked but I'm a big fan of the DC characters.</p>
