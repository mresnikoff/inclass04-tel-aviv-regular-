		<h2>Matt Resnikoff</h2>
		<img class="right img-frame" src="images/matt.jpeg" alt="Fed">
		<p>My name is Matt Resnikoff. I am currently a Junior at the U of R, majoring in Economics and double minoring in Computer Science and Journalism. 
			I got into Comp Sci fairly recently, but I have a lot of fun with the coding aspects which is why I decided to start off as the group coder. I really like tennis, both watching and playing. I just recently joined the varsity team after being a part of the club team for the past two and a half years. 
			My favorite player is Roger Federer (duh). I'm also into watching other pro sports, mainly Football and Basketball.
			I'm a huge Indianapolis Colts fan so don't try talking to me about football right now since it was a pretty rough year for me.
			

			Originally, I am from West Long Branch, New Jersey. 
			That's basically the jersey shore (which has a bad rep for some reason) and it is a wonderful place to grow up. 
			Being 15 minutes away from the beach is fantastic and the town is nice and small so everyone knows everyone.  
			I went to Shore Regional High School, our local public school. There I had a pretty decent tennis career.
			I managed to make all conferance 3 times. My tennis career has opened up a number of opportunities throughout my life. 
			I also love to travel, whether it be with friends or with family. My favorite class that I have taken in college was computer science 170, where I learned all about web design. 
			I also really enjoyed sports economics, taught by professor Rizzo. Here I learned all about different economic papers that relate to topics within sports. 
			I really like to go hiking and fishing, and I love the outdoors. My favorite animal is the wallaby as it reminds me of myself. 
			I like to wear pants, but I prefer shorts. I also tend to have a craving for anything chewy, as chewy snacks are my favorite. 
			I hate soup, I think that it is very poor for the soul. My role model in life is Paul Pierce, as he is the greatest basketball player to ever live.
			At the age of 12, I once fell off of my scooter and broke 8 toes. This was a very strange time for me as I was unable to walk until
			all of my toes were healed. I had to be wheel chaired around my middle school by my friends for a long period of time. This was particularly difficult because I am personally a very active person,
			and so it was hard for me to deal with not being able to do my normal activities, let alone walk. During this period, I became particularly skilled at sudoku.
			I started playing 3-5 hours a day, and ended up becoming a professional sudoku player by the age of 14. I participated in many tournaments world wide, winning my biggest achievement in the 14u
			tournament that took place in Sri Lanka. I stopped playing sudoku when I turned 16, and have not completed a puzzle ever since. I often think about what my life would be like
			if I pursued my talent in soduku rather than going to college, but hindsight is 2020.
