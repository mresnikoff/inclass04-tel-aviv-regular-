		<h2>Matt Resnikoff</h2>
		<img class="right img-frame" src="images/matt.jpg" alt="Fed">
		<p>My name is Matt Resnikoff. I am currently a Junior at the U of R, majoring in Economics and double minoring in Computer Science and Journalism. 
			I got into Comp Sci fairly recently, but I have a lot of fun with the coding aspects which is why I decided to start off as the group coder. I really like tennis, both watching and playing. I just recently joined the varsity team after being a part of the club team for the past two and a half years. 
			My favorite player is Roger Federer (duh). I'm also into watching other pro sports, mainly Football and Basketball.
			I'm a huge Indianapolis Colts fan so don't try talking to me about football right now since it was a pretty rough year for me.
			

			Originally, I am from West Long Branch, New Jersey. 
			That's basically the jersey shore (which has a bad rep for some reason) and it is a wonderful place to grow up. 
			Being 15 minutes away from the beach is fantastic and the town is nice and small so everyone knows everyone.  
			I went to Shore Regional High School, our local public school. There I had a pretty decent tennis career.
			I managed to make all conferance 3 times. My tennis career has opened up a number of opportunities throughout my life. 
			I also love to travel, whether it be with friends or with family. My favorite class that I have taken in college was computer science 170, where I learned all about web design. 
			I also really enjoyed sports economics, taught by professor Rizzo. Here I learned all about different economic papers that relate to topics within sports. 
			I really like to go hiking and fishing, and I love the outdoors. My favorite animal is the wallaby as it reminds me of myself. 
			I like to wear pants, but I prefer shorts. I also tend to have a craving for anything chewy, as chewy snacks are my favorite. 
			I hate soup, I think that it is very poor for the soul. My role model in life is Paul Pierce, as he is the greatest basketball player to ever live.
