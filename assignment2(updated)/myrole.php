		<h2>My Role</h2>
		<img class="right img-frame" src="images/code.jpg" alt="Code">
		<p>As I said before, my starting role for the course is going to be the coder. CSC 170 was actually the first Comp Sci course I ever took here at the U of R. Since then, I've added Java, Python, and Swift to my repetoir. I think starting off as the coder will give me the most comp sciey feel, instead of feeling like a graphic architect, so for now the coder position is all me!</p>
